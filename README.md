## Overview
This repository contains source codes for [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/) lessons whose aim is to learn Solidity by developing a game on Ethereum.

The code is divided into two folders which are themselves divided into several `lessons` :

### 1. `beginner-to-intermediate-smart-contracts`

- `lesson-1` : Builds a game on Ethereum by making a zombie factory.
- `lesson-2` : Multiplies zombies army by feeding on other lifeforms.
- `lesson-3` : Builds real decentralized application through advanced Solidity concepts like ***contract ownership***, ***gas costs***, ***code optimization*** and ***security***.
- `lesson-4` : Builds out a zombie battle function thanks to ***payable functions***.
- `lesson-5` : Brings concepts like ***tokens***, the ***ERC721 standard***, and ***crypto-collectible assets***.
- `lesson-6` : Interacts with smart contracts and builds a basic front-end using ***`Web3.js`***.

### 2. `get-in-depth-knowledge`
